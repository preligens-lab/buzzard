    This is useful to balance the number of active file descriptors.
    This is useful to perform concurrent reads if the driver does no support it.

    Features Defined
    ----------------
    - An `activate` method to manually open the driver (Mostly useless feature since opening \
        is automatic if necessary)
    - A `deactivate` method to close the driver (Useful to flush data to disk)
    - An `active_count` property
    - An `active` property
