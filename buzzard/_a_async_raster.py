    - Has an `iter_data`, a higher level wrapper of `queue_data`.

        """Read several rectangles of data on several channels from the source raster.

        Using `queue_data` instead of multiple calls to `get_data` allows more parallelism.
        The `fps` parameter should contain a sequence of `Footprint` that will be mapped to
        `numpy.ndarray`. The first ones will be computed with a higher priority than the later ones.

        Calling this method sends an asynchronous message to the Dataset's scheduler with the
        input parameters and a queue. On the input side of the queue, the scheduler will call the
        `put` method with each array requested. On the output side of the queue, the `get` method
        should be called to retrieve the requested arrays.

        The output queue will be created with a max queue size of `max_queue_size`, the scheduler
        will be careful to prepare only the arrays that can fit in the output queue. Thanks to this
        feature: backpressure can be entirely avoided.

        If you wish to cancel your request, loose the reference to the queue and the scheduler will
        gracefuly cancel the query.

        In general you should use the `iter_data` method instead of the `queue_data` one, it is much
        safer to use. However you will need to pass the `queue_data` method of a raster, to create
        another raster (a recipe) that depends on the first raster.

        Parameters
        ----------
        fps: sequence of Footprint
            The Footprints at which the raster should be sampled.
        channels:

        max_queue_size: int
            Maximum number of arrays to prepare in advance in the underlying queue.

        Returns
        -------
        queue: queue.Queue of ndarray
            The arrays are put into the queue in the same order as in the `fps` parameter.

        The `iter_data` method is a higher level wrapper around the `queue_data` method. It
        returns a python generator and while waiting for data, it periodically probes the
        Dataset's scheduler to reraise an exception if it crashed.
